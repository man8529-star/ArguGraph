I live in a house that every body in it came from acting. I remember my mom telling me this it you in find your self bad situation, don't forget your smile with "you". I think she ment that what ever is the difficulty think always positive. For an example, I grow up in place that full with bad poeple and one time some body try to convinse me to smoke. And smoking it very bad thing. So I started to tell joukes on people that canser and after 2 minutes I change the subject. Or that every time I am getting sick and fill not so good. I am trying to see comedy movies as much as I can. Because I have been told that comedy is the best cure. I think that as an actor on the stage you need to be always ready for something rong, and if you ready and prepard. This experience importent for your benfits, always a positive person and people will love you and get along with you.
